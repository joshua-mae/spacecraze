This project was made to build a cool app using NASA's APOD API to capture the interesting things about space.  The main goal was to make something that was simple and had a solid UI while also learning more about Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and MVVM.  As of now, the plan is to leave this app as is, but I would not be opposed to revisiting, so I could implement one more API or section to make this app whole.

## Tech/Frameworks
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- WebKit

## Screenshots/Demo
This place will have screenshots along with gifs going through the app.
